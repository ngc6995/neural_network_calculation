# Neural Network Calculation

Although studying neural networks is enjoyable, it can be challenging to comprehend the calculations involved. Particularly the part about backpropagation. This video provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the entire scene within a network. I meticulously record each step of the calculation. I hope it becomes useful to you in your studies. To edit the formulas, I use the Mathcha online mathematics editor. You may import the.matcha files and log in to make changes.
